Description
------------
This project is a sample program representing a "lightweight IDE".
At the moment I am simply using this project as playground for developing
and testing components, and for trying out other programming ideas.

If it ends up being a useful project and a workable IDE, that is just
a bonus. Due to my daytime work being all proprietary and closed source,
I can't showcase those. My hope is that this project will be a good substitute
for that, and show a bit of what fpGUI is capable of (in a larger real-world
project).
