  Release notes for fpGUI
  =======================


v0.6  (2008-02-17) revision 534
  - Added a new INI Utils unit which introduces ReadOnly ini support
  - Implemented the Model-GUI-Meditor design pattern so fpGUI can be
    used with tiOPF's object persistent framework. This allows any
    fpGUI component to become object-aware. I find this a better
    alternative to DB-aware components.
  - Many improvements to the GUI Designer. New property editors, new
    components, better mouse support, MRU menu etc.
  - 64-bit support is now added
  - Newly supported platforms: FreeBSD and DesktopBSD
  - Unicode text input is now supported under Windows.
  - Started implementing Message Dialogs (with multiple buttons, icons etc).
  - New components:
    * Calendar combobox
    * Gauges (pie, bar, needle, etc.)
    * DB Label example component.
  - Better support for newer desktop environments under Linux.
  - Anti-aliased line drawing support.
  - Line styles (dot, solid, dash...) are now fully supported on all platforms.
  - Implemented the Command design pattern interface. Something like 
    Delphi's TAction component.
  - Fixed many memory leaks in CoreLib units.
  - New examples/demos added: Splash Screen, Command Handler, Gauges, 
    Anti-aliased line drawing etc..
  - Started working on Message Dialogs.
  - Better clipboard support.
  - Including MANY more improvements and bug fixes. There are to 
    many to list. For a detailed listing of the changes use the svn command
    line client as follows:  svn log -r 367:534 


v0.5  (2007-09-13)
  - The first release since the rewrite of fpGUI to use a 'windowed'
    multi-handle implementation.
  - Available components in this release:
    * Button with image support
    * Label
    * Bevel (aka Panel)
    * Radio Buttons
    * Check Boxes
    * Track Bar (aka Slider)
    * Page Control (aka Tab Control)
    * List Box
    * Scrollbars
    * Memo (partially implemented)
    * Forms (Windows). Normal, Modal and Popup.
    * Dialogs
          o ShowMessage()
          o Font Selection dialog
          o File Open...
          o File Save As... 
    * Text Edit
    * Combo Box (aka Choice List)
    * Grids (aka Tables)
          o Base Grid
          o Custom Grid
          o Draw Grid
          o String Grid
          o File Grid 
    * Progress Bar
    * List View
    * Main Menu bar and Popup Menus
    * Treeview 
  - Align and Anchor support has been added.
  - Clipboard support (application wide). Global (OS based) 
    is in the works.
  - All painting is done via double buffering, so drawing flicker 
    is a thing of the past.
  - Better font support. We now have support for Font Aliases. We 
    can define a font style (font name, size and attributes) and 
    give it a text name. Whenever we want to use that font style, 
    we can reference it by the text name.
  - All colors are now defined in RGB order, no matter what platform 
    we use.
  - Modal form support (with some minor issues under Windows that 
    should be fixed soon).
  - Widgets and Forms now have a single consistent constructor due 
    to the base window class that descends from TComponent.
  - Delayed resource allocation. This is very handy under Linux where 
    the X Server can be in a remote location (not on the same computer). 
    This gives a performance bonus as we need to communicate less with 
    the X Server which is inherently slow.
  - Supports a Model-GUI-Mediator (MGM) implementation to work with 
    the tiOPF Object Persistent Framework. Business Objects can now 
    be saved in a OO fashion. The MGM implementation also makes the 
    standard fpGUI components Object-Aware. No need for DB Components.
  - fpGUI now has a Visual Form (GUI) Designer in the example/apps 
    directory. Developers can now create forms visually at a much 
    faster rate. The designer uses the same source file that contains 
    your code - generating the ui code like you would have done 
    manually. No external ui files like Lazarus (*.lfm) or Delphi 
    (*.dfm). See the readme file in the project directory for more 
    details. 


v0.4
  - The last version of fpGUI using a single handle (windowless) 
    design.
