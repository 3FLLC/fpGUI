  These are all the noted issues with fpGUI so far.
  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

* Selecting text in a Edit field doesn't work.

* Password edit resizes while you are typing. (minor property fix required)

* Scrollbar doesn't scroll when you keep the mouse clicked on the up or down
  arrows of the scrollbar.

* (fixed) Scrollbar PageSize property doesn't work 100%. See widgettest demo.

* Scrollbox seems to work, as it is used internally in the ListBox component. 
  The demo in the Widget Test Demo app needs to improve though.

* ComboBox component needs to be completed. 
  - The dropdown window has borders. (fixed but needs testing).
  - The arrow button doesn't close the dropdown window. (fixed but needs testing)
  - Text input doesn't work. (n/a combobox is a selection only component)
  - Dropdown window width is incorrect.
  - Dropdown doesn't close when combobox looses focus.

* (started) Menu's need to be implemented.

* Label component needs to be enhanced to allow for keyboard shortcuts and
  underline the keyboard shortcut letter.

* Dialog components need to be added to the Widget Test Demo.

* More standard dialog components need to be added. Example: File Dialog,
  Color Dialog, Diretory Select Dialog, etc.

* Tab component needs to be created.

* Toolbar component needs to be created.

* Treeview component needs to be created.  Maybe look at porting the 
  Virtual Treeview component.  That can double up as a altenate ListBox 
  component as well.

* Slider component

* (completed basics) Progress Bar component

* (completed basics) Panel component

* (started) Gauge/Dial/Needle component.
