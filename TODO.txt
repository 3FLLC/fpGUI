Todo list
=========
[o] - Fixes suggish scrolling. I think it's a recursive position event on the
      vertical scrollbar causing the problem.
      (*** It's much better already ***)
[ ] - Text wrapping in RichTextView is not 100% correct
[ ] - Access Violation when the application terminates.
[ ] - Ever growing list of fonts used while loading new topics.
[ ] - Settings / Customization dialog is needed.
[ ] - Open Recent Files doesn't always get populated, or gets cleared for some
      reason.
[ ] - Change mouse cursor when over hyperlinks in RichTextView
[o] - Implement a ipfdump program. Already started work on this and is called
      docdump in the src directory.
[ ] - Implement a IPF Compiler in Object Pascal
[ ] - Text is not selectable in RichTextView. I imagine people want to
      copy & paste examples. Although "Save current Topic" already exists.
[ ] - Communication between application and docview. Both directions. Possible
      solutions is Pipes or IPC unit.
[ ] - Create help file for DocView listing all supported features etc..
[ ] - Searching for two words as-is does not seem to work.
      eg: 'file descriptor' exists is fppoll help, but trying to search for
      those two words doesn't find anything.
[ ] - Sometimes searching for a word doesn't find help even though it exists.
      eg: 'descriptor' doesn't find the help in fppoll topic, even though the
      work is clearly in the topic contents.

[x] - Display topic by ID via command line parameters
[x] - 'Could not load topic slots' message when trying to view some topics.
[x] - Extend compiler or INF file format for larged Word Index list. Currently
      LCL documentation needs to be split in two, to compile. (this was an issue
      with the Open Watcom WIPFC - limit is now set to 65000 entries)
[x] - Clicking in index list should set the text in the index search edit box.
