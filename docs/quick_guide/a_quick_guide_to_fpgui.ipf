 Preface

:ecgraphic.
:p.
I've been meaning to start this book back in 2013, but always seemed to find
other things to do. I've finally decided to put pen-to-paper (in a digital
way) and get started.
:p.
:hp2.What is fpGUI:ehp2.
:p.
fpGUI Toolkit (or the Free Pascal GUI Toolkit) is a multi-platform toolkit for
creating graphical user interfaces. Offering a complete set of custom drawn
widgets, fpGUI is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to
complete application suites.
:p.
fpGUI is a 32bit and 64bit 2D graphics toolkit that doesn't rely on any huge
third party graphics libraries like GTK+ or Qt (and its dependencies). It
talks directly to the underlying graphics system (GDI, X11 etc). fpGUI is
supported on Unix, Linux, BSD, OpenSolaris, Mac OS X (via X11), Windows, and
embedded systems like ARM-Linux and WinCE.
:p.
fpGUI is open source and free software, licensed under a Modified LGPL
license. The toolkit has been implemented using the Object Pascal language,
and is meant for use with the Free Pascal compiler.
:p.
:hp2.Who This Book Is For:ehp2.
:p.
I've written this book for programmers who want to learn to use the &fpg.
toolkit, and that might not have used it, or similar toolkits before. I am
assuming that you have some basic understanding of the Object Pascal language.
:p.
This book covers using &fpg. directly (no LCL involved). The Lazarus
LCL-fpGUI widgetset is not feature complete, and not nearly ready for real
usage. My hope is that somebody will eventually take control of that aspect of
LCL and make it into a usable LCL target.
:p.
But for now, lets look at &fpg. itself!

This is the first book that I wrote using IPF and related technologies, though
I have written many shorter articles or README-style documents with it. The
master text was written primarily with the EditPad Pro v7 text editor and
using my own IPF syntax and file navigation schemes.

 A Brief History of fpGUI
þþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþ
:ecgraphic.
:p.
circa 2006.
:p.
After developing many cross platform applications with Kylix and Delphi
I started getting very frustrated with the differences between the look and
behaviour of the applications under Linux and Windows. The code was also
riddled with IFDEF statements.
:p.
Then I stumbled across the Free Pascal and Lazarus projects. I thought this
is it, the answer to all my cross platform development problems. Unfortunately
after working with Lazarus for a few months I started finding more
and more issues with the widget sets, though the IDE was great.
:p.
The Lazarus LCL is a wrapper for each platforms native widget set. This
brought with it the same issues I experienced with Kylix and Delphi. This
got me thinking about how I could resolve this issue.
:p.
Then it hit me - implement the widgetset myself using Free Pascal! Painting
the widgets myself to get a consistent look and implementing a consistent
behaviour. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I thought I would do some
searching to see if there is another project I could contribute to, or that
could give me head start.
:p.
The first version of my widgetset was based around a heavily modified
version of the Light Pascal Toolkit [http://sourceforge.net/projects/lptk]. I
then discovered the discontinued
fpGUI and fpGFX projects. I tried to contact the original author to no
avail. The &fpg. code hasn't been touched in four years (since early 2002).
After studying the code for a few weeks, I came to the conclusion that fpGUI
is much closer to what I strived to accomplish with my modified LPTK. A
lot was still missing from &fpg. though.
:p.
After thinking long and hard, I decided to start my widgetset again, but
this time based on the work done in fpGUI and fpGFX. I also added to
the mix some good ideas I saw in Qt 4.1. After a few weeks I completed quite a
few things missing in fpGUI, but I still needed to do a lot more to get it
to the point where I could test drive it in a commercial application.
I set myself a list of
outstanding things which should get it to a usable level. I also added a lot of
documentation as there was no documentation included with the
original fpGUI and fpGFX projects. Documentation is important to attract
other developers in using the widgetset.

In this chapter we will start small, and introduce some basic concepts and
terminology. In later chapters we will start with a realistic application.
:p.
I'll also assume that you have setup your development environment as
described in the :link reftype=hd refid=ch_installing_fpgui.Installing
fpGUI:elink. chapter. Because there are multiple ways to set up your build
environment, I'll make no assumption what environment you are using. So for
the rest of the book I'll simply say you must rebuild and run the application
when needed.

:exmp.

:p.
Line 1 tells the compiler this unit is the program unit - the start of an
application source code.

:p.
Line 3 tells the compiler what Pascal syntax we are using for this unit. The
&fpc. Compiler supports multiple pascal syntax modes, like Turbo Pascal,
Delphi, Object FPC  (the one we used above) etc. The $H+ directive notifies
the compiler that when we use the generic :color fc=darkred.String:color
fc=default. data type, we actually mean the :color fc=darkred.AnsiString:color
fc=default. data type. You can read more about these in the :link reftype=fn
refid=fpc_docs.Free Pascal Programmers Guide:elink..

:p.
Lines 5 and 6 specifies which other source code units to include, for the
compiler to be able to successfully compile our application. This is because
we use objects or classes defined in other units. For example the :color
fc=darkred.fpgApplication:color fc=default. object is defined in the :color
fc=darkred.fpg_main:color fc=default. unit, the :color
fc=darkred.TfpgForm:color fc=default. class is defined in the :color
fc=darkred.fpg_form:color fc=default. unit.

:p.
Lines 8 to 12 we define a new class, descending from the fpGUI TfpgForm class.
A :color fc=darkred.TfpgForm:color fc=default. is a basic representation of a
window in our application. We define a descending class, named :color
fc=darkred.TMainForm:color fc=default., so we can add our own customisations
or functionality. In Line 11 we override the :color
fc=darkred.AfterCreate:color fc=default. method, as that is a good place to
add our own customisations like the window size, window title etc. This will
be explained in more detail later in the book.

:p.
Lines 14 to 20 is the implementation of the AfterCreate method. Line 16 sets
the :color fc=darkred.Name:color fc=default. property of the TMainForm. Every
widget in fpGUI needs to have a name
assigned to it. In fpGUI terminology, a widget is a visual element displayed
in the user interface. Examples of widgets are a Button, ComboBox, Form etc.
Some widgets can also act as a container, containing other widgets. A Form and
Panel widgets are examples of container widgets - as they often contain other
widgets like a MenuBar, Buttons, Labels etc. Line 17 sets the Top, Left, Width
and Height of the main form. Line 18 sets the title (often also referred to as
a caption) of our main form.

:p.
Line 19 creates an instance of a Label widget. It also assigns the parent
widget, the position and the text to be displayed by the label widget. All
widgets in fpGUI has such a convenience CreateXXX() function. This makes in
very easy to write a single line of code to create a widget instance, and set
the most popular properties of that widget. Later in this book you will see a
different way of creating widgets - normally generated by the UI Designer
application (fpGUI's stand alone visual forms designer). The code generated by
the UI Designer is also very easy to read, and as close as possible to what a
human would have typed - thus making in very easy to read and understand.

:p.
Lines 22 to 34 we define a procedure called "MainProc". We did this simply to
organise our source code a little better. In Lines 23 and 24 we define a local
variable that will represent our application's main window. The :color
fc=darkred.frm:color fc=default. variable will hold an instance of the
TMainForm class we defined earlier.

:p.
Line 26 initialises the fpGUI framework so it is ready to run our application.

:p.
Line 27 we ask the fpgApplication to create a instance of the TMainForm class,
and save that instance in the frm variable.

:p.
Line 29 makes the main window visible. In fpGUI all widgets are created hidden
so it gives as a chance to make customisation (eg: changing the displayed
text, or size of the widget) without causing any flicker.

:p.
Line 30 tells the fpGUI framework to start running our program, and process
any system or user generated events. Behind the scenes an application
generates many events. They are defined in two categories. User generated
events would be something like when the mouse is clicked on a button.
Operating System events would be clipboard handling, placing windows in a
specific location on the desktop etc. You don't need to worry too much about
these, the fpGUI framework takes care of all this for you.

:p.
Line 32 frees our TMainForm instance, referenced by the frm variable,
releasing the memory used back to the operating system. In Object Pascal you
normally need to free all class instances you create.

:p.
Line 36 to 38 is the main code block for the program unit. We simply call the
MainProc procedure which kickstarts our application.

:p.
You can now build the program, and when you run it, it should display a
windows as can be seen in Figure 1. Your first fpGUI application!

:p.

:p.
Other that the window borders and window icon, the content of the window
should be identical on all fpGUI supported platforms.

:ecgraphic.
:p.
This is still a work in progress until I can find a suitable solution. I'm
not 100% satisfied with this, but it's a quick and easy way to get things
to compile. I'll assume you have the :color fc=darkred.fpc:color fc=default.
executable setup in your system's
PATH environment variable so it
can be run from any location on your computer. I'll also assume your global
:color fc=darkred.fpc.cfg:color fc=default. file has been setup correctly so
the &fpc. can find the RTL and
FCL units.

:p.
Under Linux, *BSD, OpenSolaris and Mac OS X run:
:xmp.
 cd <fpgui>/src
 build.sh
:exmp.

:p.
Under Windows run:
:xmp.
 cd <fpgui>\src
 build.bat
:exmp.
:p.
The :color fc=darkred.extrafpc.cfg:color fc=default. file located in the
:color fc=darkred.src:color fc=default. directory is combined with your global
fpc.cfg file. The local extrafpc.cfg file sets up all the required search and
include paths to compile the :color fc=darkred.corelib:color fc=default. and
:color fc=darkred.gui:color fc=default. directories.
:p.
All compiled units (*.o and *.ppu) are saved in the <fpgui>/lib directory. This
makes the search paths for you applications a little easier to setup.

:h3.Integration with Lazarus IDE

 Integration with Lazarus IDE
þþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþþ
:ecgraphic.
:p.
Lazarus IDE is a very versatile IDE and allows you to create many types of
projects with it. Those include LCL desktop applications, web applications,
console applications, and more importantly, fpGUI Toolkit applications.
:p.
To accomplish the latter, follow these simple steps:
:p.
:hp2.Lets configure Lazarus to have a new project type::ehp2.
:ol.
:li.Run Lazarus and open the :color fc=darkred.fpgui_toolkit.lpk:color
fc=default. package found in the
following location:
:xmp.
 <fpgui>/src/corelib/[x11|gdi]/fpgui_toolkit.lpk
:exmp.
:note.The [x11|gdi] means you need to choose the "x11" or "gdi" directory
based on
your platform.
:p.
Click "Compile".

:li.Now you need to install the IDE add-on package which registers a new
project
type with Lazarus IDE. Do that by opening the :color
fc=darkred.fpgui_ide.lpk:color fc=default. package, found at:
:xmp.
 <fpgui>/extras/lazarus_ide/fpgui_ide.lpk
:exmp.
:p.
Click "Compile" and then "Install". Lazarus will rebuild and restart itself.
:eol.

:p.
:hp2.Now to create a &fpg. application::ehp2.
:ol.
:li.Run Lazarus
:li.Select ":hp2.Project:ehp2. ¯ :hp2.New Project...:ehp2." and select "fpGUI
Toolkit Application".
:eol.

:p.
All done, you have created your first fpGUI application using
Lazarus IDE as your editor! :)

This page describes how &fpg.'s forms designer application, UIDesigner, can be
integrated with Lazarus IDE. Thus allowing you to launch the forms designer
with a simple keyboard shortcut, and automatically load the current file being
edited by Lazarus IDE.
:p.
For this to work, we opted to use the External Tools feature of Lazarus.
Alternative methods exist, but that requires recompiling the IDE - and that
seems like just to much effort.
:p.
The process is quite simple. While in Lazarus, simply select the menu items
":hp2.Tools:ehp2. ¯ :hp2.Configure External Tools...:ehp2.". A dialog will
appear. Select the "Add" button, and then fill in the details as
shown in the screen below. Please use the correct path to the UIDesigner
executable.
:p.
Once you have entered all the details, click the OK button, and you have setup
the UIDesigner inside Lazarus IDE.
