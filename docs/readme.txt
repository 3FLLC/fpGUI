fpGUI information
=================

 This version of fpGUI is based on a implementation where every
 widget has a window handle. In other words every widget is actually
 a embedded window in the Form (yet another window).
  
 Revision 127 was the last revision which still had the old design - one
 handle per Form.
 It has been tagged in SubVersion as /tags/single_handle_fpgui
 
 From revision 227, the new design (multi-handle implementation) has
 become the new default implementation of fpGUI. It was a complete
 rewrite of the code.
